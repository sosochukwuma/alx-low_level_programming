## C - More functions, more nested loops

In this project, I continued to learn about using nested loops and writing functions in C.

* Header File: `main.h` contains prototypes for all functions written in the project.

* 0-isupper.c: wrote a function that checks for uppercase characters. Returns `1` if the character is uppercase, `0` otherwise.

* 1-isdigit.c: wrote a function that checks for a digit (`0` through `9`). Returns `1` if the character is a digit, `0` otherwise.

* 2-mul.c: wrote a function that multiplies two integers. Returns the value of the multiplication.

* 3-print_numbers.c: wrote a function in `c` that prints the numbers `0` to `9`, followed by a new line.

* 4-print_most_numbers: wrote a function that prints the numbers `0` to `9` except for `2` and `4`, followed by a new line.

* 5-more_numbers.c: wrote a function that prints the numbers `0` to `14`, followed by a new line, ten times.

* 6-print_line.c: wrote a function that draws a straight line in the terminal using the character `_`, followed by a new line.Such that if the function receives length input of zero or less, only a new line is printed.

* 7-print_diagonal.c: wrote a function that draws a diagonal line in the terminal using the `\` character, followed by a new line.

* 8-print_square.c: C function that prints a square using the `#` character, followed by a new line.

* 9-fizz_buzz.c: wrote a program that prints the numbers from `1` to `100`, but for multiples of three, `Fizz` is printed instead of the number, for multiples of five, `Buzz`, and for multiples of both three and five, `FizzBuzz`

* 10-print_triangle.c: wrote a function that prints a triangle using the `#` character, followed by a new line.

* 100-prime_factor.c: wrote a program that prints the largest prime factor of the number `612852475143`, followed by a new line.

* 101-print_number.c: wrote a function that prints an integer without using `long`, arrays, pointers, or hard-coded special values.
