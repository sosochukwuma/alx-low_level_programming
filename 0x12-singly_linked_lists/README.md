## C - Singly linked lists

* lists.h: Header file containing definitions and prototypes for all types and functions written for the project.

* 0-print_list.c: wrote a function that prints all the elements of a `list_t` list. If `str` is `NULL`, the function prints `[0] (nil)`.

* 1-list_len.c: wrote a function that returns the number of elements in a linked `list_t` list.

* 2-add_node.c: wrote a function that adds a new node at the beginning a of a `list_t` list.
    * If the function fails - returns `NULL`.
    * Otherwise - returns the address of the new element.

* 3-add_node_end.c: wrote a function that adds a new node at the end of a linked `list_t` list.
    * If the function fails - returns `NULL`.
    * Otherwise - returns the address of the new element.

* 4-free_list.c: wrote a function that frees a `list_t` list.

* 100-first.c: wrote a function that prints `You're beat! and yet, you must allow,\nI bore my house upon my back!\n` before the `main` unction is executed.

* 101-hello_holberton.asm: 64-but assembly program that prints `Hello, Holberton` followed by a new line using only the `printf` function witout interrupts.
