## 0x03. C - Debugging

#Debugging is the correcting and elimination of malfunctions and errors codes. It's not just about knowing how to takeaway the euros but also how to locate where the errors are as well as knowing what error it is and the cause.


* 0-main.c: created the file `0-main.c` which would test that the function `positive_or_negative()` gives the correct output when given a case of `0`

* 1-main.c: commented out the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop

* 2-largest_number.c: fixed the code in `2-largest_number.c` now it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case

* 3-print_remaining_days.c: fixed the `print_remaining_days()` function, now the output works correctly for all dates, years and leap years
