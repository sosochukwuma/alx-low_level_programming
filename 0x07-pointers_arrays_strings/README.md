##C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings

* main.h: the header file containing prototypes for all functions written in the project.

* 0-memset.c: wrote a C function that fills the first `n` bytes of memory area pointed to by `s` with the constant byte `b` and this returns a pointer to the filled memory area `s`.

* 1-memcpy.c: wrote a function that copies `n` bytes from memory area `src` to memory area `dest`such that it returns a pointer to the memory area `dest`.

* 2-strchr.c: wrote a function that returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the character `c` in the string `s`. So if the character is not found, the function returns `NULL`.

* 3-strspn.c: wrote a function that returns the number of bytes in the initial segment of memory area `s` which consist only of bytes from a substring `accept`.

* 4-strpbrk.c: wrote a function that locates the first occurrence in a string `s` of any of the bytes in a string `accept`. So that it returns a pointer to the byte in `s` that matches one of the bytes in `accept` and if no matching byte is found, the function returns `NULL`.

* 5-strstr.c: wrote a function that finds the first occurrence of a substring `needle` in a string `haystack`. Here the terminating null bytes (`\0`) are not compared, it returns a pointer to the beginning of the located substring and if the substring is not found, the function returns `NULL`.

* 7-print_chessboard.c: wrote a function that prints the chessboard.

* 8-print_diagsums.c: wrote a function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.

* 100-set_string.c: wrote a function that sets the value of a pointer to a char.

* 101-crackme_password: created a file containing the password for the 'crackme2' executable.
